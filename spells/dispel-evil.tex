Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects.\\
First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks by evil creatures.\\
Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful Will save (spell resistance applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.\\
Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by \textit{dispel magic }also can't be dispelled by \textit{dispel evil}. Saving throws and spell resistance do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.\\
