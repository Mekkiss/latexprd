\spellentry{Symbol of Pain}
\textbf{School} necromancy [evil]; \textbf{Level} cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5\\
\textbf{Components} V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)\\
This spell functions like \textit{symbol of death}, except that each creature within the radius of a \textit{symbol of pain }instead suffers wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.\\
Unlike \textit{symbol of death}, \textit{symbol of pain }has no hit point limit; once triggered, a \textit{symbol of pain }simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.\\
\textit{Note}: Magic traps such as \textit{symbol of pain }are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for \textit{symbol of pain}.\\
